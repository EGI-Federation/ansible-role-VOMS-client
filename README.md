# EGI VOMS Client

## General information

### About VOMS and VOs

This is an Ansible role which configures VOMS clients. VOMS is a web service for
managing membership of Virtual Organisations. VOMS clients are necessary to
obtain authorisation (in the form of short-lived proxies) for interacting with
specific services, based on VO membership. VOMS clients are set of command-line
utilities which send authenticated requests to the relevant VOMS server in order
to request authorisation from them.

In order to use the VOMS client, an individual needs to

- have a personal x.509 certificate
- be registered in the VO they want to get an authorisation for

VOMS clients are typically installed on the User Interface or Worker Node
profiles.

### Configuration

Configuration of the VOMS clients is done with a few files:

1. `.lsc` files
2. `vomses` files

See
[the VOMS documentation](http://italiangrid.github.io/voms/documentation/voms-clients-guide/3.0.4/#voms-trust)
for more detailed information.

For every VO you wish to interact with, the relevant configuration needs to be
in place. This can be quite a time-consuming task, especially in cases where a
site administrator does not know _a-priori_ which VOs to configure.

To make life bearable, we take a **data-driven** approach.

The necessary data is available via the
[EGI Operations Portal API](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/api-documentation),
which is used in this role as a data source. This allows us to configure **all**
VOs registered in the Operations Portal in one foul swoop. Two approaches could
be taken to generating the configuration:

1. configuration from raw data pulled from Lavoisier at Ansible runtime
1. configuration from filtered data pulled from Lavoisier prior to Ansible
   runtime.

In the former approach, a well-crafted
[`json_query`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#json-query-filter)
could be used to iterate over the data returned from Lavoisier. The query in
this case needs to reflect the complexity and structure of the data object
returned by Lavoisier, which cannot be assumed to return an array of consistent
data. In the latter approach, a much simpler is used to iterate over a cached
data object, which has been filtered to exclude items which do not contain the
relevant information. This cached data can be easily created by a simple python
script - [files/create_clean_vo_data.py](files/create_clean_vo_data.py) which
reads the role vars and creates a local cache of data. The data format has been
chosen to be YAML so that we can add it to the repository and keep track of
changes - this would be difficult with JSON, due to the lack of lines.

We have opted for the latter (see
[4215026e18c](https://github.com/EGI-Federation/ansible-role-VOMS-client/commit/52ac706fe059a336244bb2e4af0bdee2f37752a6))
for the following reasons:

1. It is easier to _maintain_ a well-documented script than a complex json
   query.
2. It is easier to _read_ a well-documented script than a complex json query
3. If the role is added as a dependency to playbooks (as will certainly be the
   case, since the voms clients are used all over the place), the data needs to
   be present.

There is however the drawback that the data in the repo can quickly become out
of synch with the actual data on Lavoisier. This could happen either by
individuals editing the cache by hand, or by the maintainer not running the
script when necessary. The only way to overcome this is to maintain a strong
test suite.

### Updating the VO data

In order to update the VO data using
[files/create_clean_vo_data.py](files/create_clean_vo_data.py), an
authentication token is required to interact with the
[EGI Operations Portal API](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/api).

The token can be generated by accessing, while being authenticated via
[EGI Check-in](https://docs.egi.eu/users/aai/check-in), the
[Operations Portal API documentation page](https://operations-portal.egi.eu/api-documentation),
follow the instructions on the page, and then export the token into the
environment before running
[files/create_clean_vo_data.py](files/create_clean_vo_data.py).

It is possible to test that the token is working using a
[curl](https://curl.se/) call:

```shell
# Exporting Operations Portal API token
$ export OPS_PORTAL_API_TOKEN='...'
# Testing an API call using curl
$ curl -X GET "https://operations-portal.egi.eu/api/vo-voms/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: $OPS_PORTAL_API_TOKEN"
```

Once the `curl` call is confirmed to work, it's possible to use the provided
script:

```shell
# Exporting Operations Portal API token
$ export OPS_PORTAL_API_TOKEN='...'
# Updating the VO data
$ ./files/create_clean_vo_data.py
```

## Testing

The role is tested with [molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for the following scenarios:

- `default` (tested with
  [TestInfra](http://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

Tests cover unit and integration tests, but not functional tests, since a
personal certificate is necessary for using the VOMS client. Specific tests
included are:

- presence of binary executables
- presence of configuration directories
- contents of configuration files for selected VOs

## Requirements

See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

## Role Variables

Role variables kept on `defaults/main.yml` include:

- `prerequisites` - the prerequisite packages on an OS-basis
- `voms_dir`, `vomses_dir` - directory locations on the target host which
  contain the voms information
- `lavoisier` - the lavoisier framework endpoints necessary for extracting the
  data necessary to populate the configuration files.

There is no need to change the default variables.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are not explicitly declared in the metadata, but this role depends
on the UMD role:

```yaml
- { role: EGI-Foundation.umd, release: 4 }
```

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - { role: EGI-Foundation.umd, release: 4 }
    - { role: EGI-Foundation.voms-client }
```

### Supporting only a limited numbers of VO

This can be achieved by setting the `supported_vos` variables, as an example,
if one would like to include only support for biomed, dteam and ops:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  vars:
    supported_vos:
      - biomed
      - dteam
      - ops
  roles:
    - { role: EGI-Foundation.umd, release: 5 }
    - { role: EGI-Foundation.voms-client }
```
